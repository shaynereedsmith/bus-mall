# Bus Mall

The point of this project is to create an application that displays three products randomly from a selection of 20. The user will then click on which product they like the most. The page will then replace those items with three new items. The user continues selecting their favorites until the process is tallied through 25 times. A list with then show which displays the total number of clicks for each product.
